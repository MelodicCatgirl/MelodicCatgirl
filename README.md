hi im Layla, also known as MelodicCatgirl. i'm a Mario Kart Wii modder, Linux enjoyer, and sometimes a YouTuber/musician.

i don't really use GitHub for much. i used to code as a hobby when i was younger, but i lost interest and i haven't really coded anything since like 2020 (other than like shell scripting ig). as such, you won't really find much here. currently my only repositories are things for [my color scheme](https://github.com/MelodicCatgirl/layla-color-scheme), which i doubt anybody else wants to use anyways but i don't care.
